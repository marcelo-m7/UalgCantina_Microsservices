# **App Name**: CantinaCast

## Core Features:

- Menu Display: Displays the weekly menu, fetched from the API, allowing users to view available dishes for each day and meal.
- Allergen Filter: Enables filtering of menu items based on allergens, cross-referencing dish details with allergen information.
- Federated Authentication: Integrates Firebase Authentication for secure access to the administrative dashboard, managing user roles.
- Admin Dashboard: Presents a dashboard with CRUD operations for menus, dishes, and allergens, ensuring an intuitive interface for administrators.
- AI-Powered Menu Suggestions: AI tool that suggests menu pairings. For example, if the system detects there's a chicken dish on Monday, it will look at a list of side dishes in its memory and reason over the nutritional compatibility and past popularity, then respond to the admin user with a possible recommendation for that side dish.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft blue (#64B5F6), reminiscent of a clear sky, to evoke feelings of freshness and openness.
- Background color: Very light blue (#E3F2FD) for a clean and calming user experience, maintaining focus on content.
- Accent color: A subdued, darker shade of blue-purple (#3F51B5) used sparingly for actionable elements, creating contrast and visual interest.
- Clean, sans-serif font to maintain clarity on the menu items.
- Use clear icons representing dish types (vegetarian, meat, fish) and allergens to help at-a-glance recognition.
- The app layout should be centered, maximizing screen real estate and placing related controls logically, for an easier administrative experience.
- Subtle transitions when filtering menus or allergens, giving feedback when changes happen to the on-screen items.
